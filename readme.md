# Catan Translator

This personal project was developed because I brought my Slovenian game Settler of Catan to Sweden, where I wanted to play it with my international friends. As others didn't speak Slovenia, they couldn't understand the game and its many development cards. So I decided to make this app, which allows you to enter a Slovenian text (don't worry, you can make typos, the app is forgiving) and it outputs the appropriate English translation. With this app, we could finally play the game together.

The app was made in 2016 using AngularJS and Angular Material and ported as an Android app using Apache Cordova. It can be found online here: https://apps.nejo.si/catan-translator/
